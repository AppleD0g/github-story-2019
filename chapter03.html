<h1>Chapter 3 </h1>

<p>I got up early in the morning and went downstairs. The ground was slightly wet and it was raining. The fine rain wire was slightly cool. I didn't stop. I ran in the rain, crossed the road, and ran south along the alley in the east side of the city. The paved road on the bank of the embankment is already wet, and the corridor made of stone is even more wet. In the rain, the people who exercised were less, and they walked back and forth on the embankment in twos and threes. Some squatted their arms and strode across; some ran small steps and smashed forward; but they usually had less to twist their necks. </p>
<P>Someone hangs a coat on a bald branch near the corridor, hanging there alone, like a meditator leaning against the tree. The poplars on the bank of the embankment have emerged with fine yellow and yellow leaves, gently hanging on the shore, some breeze, want to stretch the dance but have a kind of lazy spring sleep. The big iron boat on the river is less than usual, the water surface is slightly waved, the water on the river is connected with the sand of the sky, and there is a mist. Looking at the distance is the smog. </P>
<p>The houses on the other side, the roads and the trees on both sides are covered with a layer of water. It is a picture of the smoke and rain of the ink, and it feels moist and moist. In the distance is the black soil in the middle of the squat and the wheat and green vegetables on the black land. The rain is getting bigger, the tower is dripping, the leaves are wet, the water is washed, and your eyes are clear. The water droplets washed from the leaves rolled on the leaves and rolled onto the ground. The river surface has also risen with water, and it has been alive and again, and all of them are colorless fragrances.</p>

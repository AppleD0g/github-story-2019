<h1>Chapter 3 </h1>

<p>In this way, everything has been renewed, and it has ushered in a good time for us. The burly sycamore tree stands in the rain, and the purple buds sway sweetly. Unload troubles, find joy, spring rain is also a precious soul.</p>
<p>Invite a few intimate friends to travel with a simple heart will make you forget the troubles of trivial matters and forget the inner uneasiness and embarrassment. Qingshan, sunset, sunset, together with the fragrance of flowers and plants, what more comfortable than this moment? There is also the warmth and perfection of nature, all of which are affixed with a thin film, all of which will be in the spread of the atmosphere, slowly intoxicating the hearts we have already traveled.</p>
<p>When you are bored and tired of work, and conflicting with friends... We can carry a simple emotion, in this season, let the heart wander and join the embrace of nature. I think there is nothing more pleasant than this. Only you and me at this moment will become more real and more realistic. The hustle and bustle of the city is in the ear, and the troubles of the world are no longer entangled in the heart. Thanks for this beautiful season, and thanks to this simple feeling!</p>

<h1>Alternative Ending </h1>

<p>As night falls, the window is surprisingly quiet!
The twilight surrounded the whole small town, quietly, my thoughts were still active in the memory of the white spring, carrying the spring breeze, layer by layer, and I walked into the moon with the moonlight outside the window. In the text, time has passed very quickly. This spring is just around the turn of us. The footsteps of the years have entered the Spring Festival! What kind of mood does this spring weather bring to people?
Intermittent, I think, look, read and wait! Looking forward to the rain that spring has infiltrated into my capillaries, I clearly feel the urge to spring this time! The green grass, jumping hard in the wind, tearing my frequent nightmare again and again!
Spring is coming, the road in front of my eyes is full of green words, reading the words that are familiar and somewhat strange, and my heart overflows with a warm current...</p>

<p>
Just as I sat in the sunset and looked at the cloud that was taken in March, while the gentle wind was blowing and I really enjoyed it.
I look at everything in front of me and think of a sentence when March is finished, but the peaceful feeling I got from Spring will stay!
Keeping this thought, I have been keeping a positive attitude toward everything.</p>

<p>
In April, the green branches of the willows swayed in the wind, the peach blossoms in the mountains were dazzling, the yellowish dead branches faded a little, and the greenery increased. It seems that the whole world has vitality. Especially in the countryside, surrounded by greenery, green grass and green mountains, the color of spring is getting deeper and deeper with the seasons.
The green of the initial bud is yellowish; after the transition, it is light green; then extending, it is dark green. The color of Hunchun, the green is slowly taking the lead, and it is sprouting in the face of the sun.</p>

<p>Can you feel it? Spring has sprung.</p>
